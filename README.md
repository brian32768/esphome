I followed the instructions on the [ESPHome Getting Started
page](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_command_line.html)

```bash
 conda create --name=esphome python pip
 conda activate esphome
 pip install esphome
``` 

Create a YAML file

```bash
esphome wizard wrover2.yaml
```

Process the YAML file, will attempt OTA upgrade on the Docker version, because it can't find the serial port.

```bash
esphome run wrover2.yaml
```

Process the YAML and do upgrade over USB port on Linux.

```bash
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}":/config --device=/dev/tty.usbserial-1410 -it esphome/esphome wrover2.yaml run
```

## ESP-C3-12F notes

This is a device that looks like an ESP8266 based ESP-12F
but has a C3 processor so it's different. But ESPhome supports it.
I am going to solder one into a Martin Jerry switch to test the concept.

```bash
esphome wizard mj-c3.yaml
```

1. I named my node mj1. I am sure this is a duplicate but all the nodes are in a box on the shelf right now so I will risk it.

2. I set CPU to ESP32 but there was no option for this board so I took a stab at "esp32-c3-mli-kit" which is "Ai-Thinker ESP-C3-M1-I-Kit". 
This is a NodeMCU look-alike.
I think ESPHome should support any board that PlatformIO supports.
You can override settings. See https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/boards/espressif32/esp32-c3-m1i-kit.html.
I suspect as long as I leave it plugged into the programmer it will
work just like the NodeMCU board.

3. I set it to use wildsong2 wifi

4. I did not set any OTA password.

I should be able to build now, but this failed with a missing arduino file.
I don't even want to use Arduino, and I found that I could edit the YAML
and change framework: type: arduino to esp-idf then I was off to the races.

```bash
esphome config mj-c3.yaml
esphome compile mj-c3.yaml
```

esptool.py --before default_reset --after hard_reset --baud 115200 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --chip esp32c3 write_flash -z --flash_size detect 0x10000 .esphome/build/mj1/.pioenvs/mj1/firmware.bin 0x0 .esphome/build/mj1/.pioenvs/mj1/bootloader.bin 0x8000 .esphome/build/mj1/.pioenvs/mj1/partitions.bin 0x9000 .esphome/build/mj1/.pioenvs/mj1/ota_data_initial.bin

## M5StickC notes

### Water heater

I am using an RS485 hat.
https://wiki.wildsong.biz/index.php?title=M5StickC

I set the RS485 pins in econet_base.yaml

### Display

For a year or so the display would not work because the AXP192 power management unit was not supported.

I found a water level warning project on ESPHome that has the AXP192 support so I used it.
